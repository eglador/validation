            <p></p>
            <h4>Right to Access, Edit, and Remove Your Information</h4>
            <p></p>
            <p>You have a right to access personal information we hold about you. Whenever you use our Site or Eglador Validation
                Services, we strive to make sure that the Personal Information is correct. If that information is wrong,
                we give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for
                legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your Personal Information, we may ask you to verify
                your identity before making any changes. We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive,
                require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally
                changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for
                instance, requests concerning information residing on backup systems). Where we can provide information
                access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort.
                Because we protect information from accidental or malicious destruction, even after information is
                deleted from the Eglador Validation Services, it may not be immediately deleted from Eglador Validation’s servers. To
                request removal of your Personal Information from our Site, Services, blog or social media, contact us
                at hello [at] eglador.github.io/validation In some cases, we may not be able to remove your Personal Information, in
                which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p>
            <p>If a User interacts with one of our Customers and the User seeks to access, or correct, amend, or delete
                inaccurate data or no longer wants to be contacted by one of our Customers, the User should direct its
                inquiry to the Customer because the Customer is the data controller. If the Customer requests Eglador Validation
                to remove the Personal Information, we will respond to their request within 30 days.</p>
            <p></p>

            <h3>Security Measures</h3>
            <p></p>
            <p>We take measures to enhance the security of our Site and the Eglador Validation Service. These measures include
                using SSL Certificates and two-factor authentication. It is important for you to protect against
                unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. No security measures are perfect and we
                cannot promise that the information about you will remain secure in all circumstances.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h3>Do Not Track Signal</h3>
            <p></p>
            <p>We treat the data of everyone who comes to our site in accordance with this Privacy Policy, whatever
                their Do Not Track setting.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h3>Children</h3>
            <p></p>
            <p>Our site is intended for a general audience and we do not knowingly collect personal information from
                anyone under the age of 13.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h3>How Eglador Validation Collects Information?</h3>
            <p></p>
            <p>Cookies are small data files placed on your computer by the websites you visit and the emails you read
                and can be used to help recognize you when you return to a website, or when you visit other sites. We,
                or third party service providers, may use cookies to, among other things, measure activity, personalize
                your experience, remember your viewing preferences, or track your status or progress when accessing our
                site. For some of these purposes, our cookies may be tied to Personal Information and/or Potential PII.
                In particular, the Eglador Validation Services use first-party cookies to maintain a coherent scope for a user
                session across multiple pages on a single website. These cookies do not track the same user across
                unrelated domains and, as described above, attempts to infer identity across domains is strictly
                prohibited.</p>
            <p>Local Storage is a standard facility provided by HTML5-compliant browsers used to retain data on your
                computer across visits to the same website. We use local storage as a temporary holding area for user
                events that were observed locally but, due to the timing of a page unload, were unable to be transmitted
                as part of the user session. Return visits to the same website read and transmit events previously
                stored in local storage to complete previously recorded sessions.</p>
            <p>This information may in the aggregate identify a User, however we will not identify a User as they browse
                the web if the User turns off cookies, as explained below.</p>
            <p>Eglador Validation does not and will not ever attempt to identify the same person across disparate, unrelated
                domains. It is a violation of our Acceptable Use Policy for our customers to attempt to build multi-site
                user profiles for the intent of selling or exchanging lists of users or demographic information.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h3>Opting Out</h3>
            <p></p>
            <p>If you wish to prevent all websites using the Eglador Validation Services to be able to record an its activity, you
                can opt-out of the Eglador Validation Services. Opting out will create a cookie that tells Eglador Validation to turn off
                recording on any site which uses the Eglador Validation Services. The presence of this cookie is required to
                continue opting out, so if you clear your browser cookies, you will have to opt-out again. (We regret
                that there isn't a better way to make your opt-out more permanent, but due to technical reasons, this
                really is the best we can do at present.)</p>
            <p></p>
            <h3>Blocking Cookies</h3>
            <p></p>
            <p>If you choose, you can set your browser to reject cookies or you can manually delete individual or all of
                the cookies on your computer by following your browser’s help file directions. Note that turning off
                cookies may also disable functions of many websites you visit. If your browser is set to reject cookies
                or you manually delete cookies, Eglador Validation will not be able to coalesce your anonymous user identity
                automatically into sessions across pages on the same website.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h3>EU Privacy Shield Framework</h3>
            <p></p>
            <p>Eglador Validation complies with the EU Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the EU regarding the collection,
                use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries. Eglador Validation has certified
                that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer,
                Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability. If
                there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the
                Privacy Shield Principles will govern.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h3>Changes</h3>
            <p></p>
            <p>We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. When there are changes to this Privacy Policy, we
                will update this page. The date on the bottom will always indicate when we last made changes. If you are
                a visitor to this Site and disagree with the Privacy Policy, you should leave the Site and/or cancel
                your agreement with Eglador Validation.</p>
